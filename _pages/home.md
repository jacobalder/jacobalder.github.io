I am a consultant for Deloitte Consulting, LLP. I also maintain an independent consulting venture: Alder Metrics LLC.

My passion is environmental justice. I am committed to building an equitable energy future with improved access to a healthy and vibrant environment. I spend a great deal of time thinking and reading about ways to improve community access to restorative justice. As a graduate student, I focused on water rights and energy access--utility disconnections for nonpayment in particular. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a research associate to measure assess home energy retrofits and energy efficiency programs; clean electricity programs; and vehicle and roadway electrification. 

I hold a graduate policy degree from the O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, Indiana University-Bloomington.
