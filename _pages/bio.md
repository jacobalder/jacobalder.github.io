I call the beautiful Rocky Mountains home -- I grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah hiking, cycling, and admiring the rugged outdoors. I attended Utah State University, my soul home at the base of Logan Canyon in northern Utah. There, I studied economics and ecological economic theory, as well as electrical engineering and mathematics. I graduated with an honors degree in economics and followed my sweetheart to Indiana where I have come to appreciate forests and birdsong.

Since I was young, my focus and passion has been making the benefits of clean and energy accessible to all people. I want to live in a healthier harmony with my community(ies), which I believe necessarily includes the natural world. I see systems, e.g., society, health, energy, technology, education in this light: all life is interdependent.

As I have learned more about distributional effects of the energy transition, my focus has shifted to emphasize Energy Justice, and I am currently a graduate research assistant to Dr. Sanya Carley and Dr. David Konisky in the [Energy Justice Lab](https://energyjustice.indiana.edu/) at Indiana University. Various research and professional opportunities have lead me to this current pursuit, including utility ratepayer advocacy work with [Dr. Ezra Hausman](https://www.ezrahausman.com/), building energy and design engineering with [McKinstry Co. LLC](https://www.mckinstry.com/), and dynamic modelling and battery-testing with the NSF-funded electric vehicle consortium [ASPIRE](https://aspire.usu.edu/). See my full C.V. [here](/_vita/alder_jacob_20211118.pdf "Current C.V.").

Recently, in my spare time, I have decided I sincerely enjoy baking bread. You can view my gateway bread recipe [here](/assets/recipes/GATEWAY_BREAD_JCA.pdf).
